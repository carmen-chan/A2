        "The world of telecommunications is changing - mobile phones and the accessibility of mobile data has changed what companies can offer and what customers value. As the world becomes more interconnected customers have higher demands for internet service and lowered use of traditional phones. Due to this shift, new companies are emerging that offer low prices on data only plans which threaten the traditional telecommunication companies (telco). As competition grows retaining current customers is increasingly important - understanding what different customers are using in a telco service and what are important to offer can help telco companies personalise a customers experience. \n",

Using machine learning algorithms we will classify which customers will churn or be retained which demonstrates the type of customers that are satisfied with their service and those who are not so we may learn from them to increase retention. \n",
